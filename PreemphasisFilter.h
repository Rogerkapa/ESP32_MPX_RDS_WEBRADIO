 *                    FM Pre-Emphasis Filter (IIR First-Order)
 *

 *
 * File:         PreemphasisFilter.h
 * Description:  FM broadcast pre-emphasis (high-frequency boost) for noise reduction
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   This module implements the standard FM broadcast pre-emphasis filter, a first-order
 *   IIR filter that boosts high frequencies (treble) before transmission. FM receivers
 *   apply a complementary de-emphasis filter to restore flat response and reduce
 *   high-frequency noise (HF noise is typically more prevalent in the RF channel).
 *
 *   Pre-emphasis is standardized across FM broadcast systems:
 *     * 75 us time constant (North America, most of world) -> cutoff ~2.1 kHz
 *     * 50 us time constant (Europe) -> cutoff ~3.2 kHz
 *
 *   Discrete-time implementation used here (allocation-free, stable):
 *     y[n] = gain * (x[n] - alpha * x[n-1])
 *     where alpha = exp(-1 / (tau * fs)). Here fs is the DAC/MPX rate, because
 *     pre-emphasis runs after the 4x upsampler.
 *
 *   Notes:
 *     * This "leaky differentiator" form implements the pre-emphasis high-pass
 *       response (zero at DC, +20 dB/dec slope) and is standard for simple FM encoders.
 *     * Use PREEMPHASIS_GAIN to manage overall program level after treble boost.
 *
 * Stereo Processing:
 *   Left and right channels are filtered independently with separate state variables
 *   (prev_left_, prev_right_) to preserve stereo image and prevent crosstalk.
 *
 * Design:
 *   * First-order high-pass (1 zero at z=1) with leaky term alpha
 *   * Difference form: y[n] = gain * (x[n] - alpha * x[n-1])
 *   * In-place processing (output buffer can be same as input)
 *   * Configurable via configure(alpha, gain) for flexibility
 *
 * Thread Safety:
 *   Not thread-safe. Must be called exclusively from Core 0 audio processing task.
 *   reset() must not be called while process() is active.
 *
 * Typical Configuration:
 *   Use Config::PREEMPHASIS_ALPHA and Config::PREEMPHASIS_GAIN.
