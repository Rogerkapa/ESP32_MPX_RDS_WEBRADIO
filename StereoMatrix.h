 * Description:  Real-time conversion of stereo audio to normalized M/S format for FM multiplex
 * Scaling:      M = 0.5f * (L + R), S = 0.5f * (L - R)
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   This module decomposes interleaved stereo audio (L, R pairs) into two independent
 *   signals required for FM stereo broadcasting:
 *     * Mono sum: M = L + R (baseband 0-15 kHz, full-range amplitude)
 *     * Stereo difference: S = L - R (modulated onto 38 kHz, half-amplitude for DSB-SC)
 *
 *   FM receivers reconstruct stereo via:
 *     L = (M + S) / 2
 *     R = (M - S) / 2
 *
 *   This matrix is the critical link between the audio input domain and the multiplex
 *   synthesis pipeline.
 *
 * Processing:
 *   Input:  Interleaved stereo samples [L0, R0, L1, R1, L2, R2, ...]
 *   Output: Two contiguous mono buffers (mono[], diff[]) containing DAC-rate samples
 *
 *   The operation is stateless and allocation-free (no buffers allocated internally).
 *   Suitable for real-time processing on Core 0 at DAC block rate.
 *
 * Design:
 *   * Direct matrix computation: 2 operations per sample pair (1 add, 1 subtract)
 *   * In-place processing supported (if mono and diff don't overlap input)
 *   * Deterministic: O(n) complexity, no branching or recursion
 *
 * Thread Safety:
 *   Not thread-safe. Must be called exclusively from Core 0 audio processing task
 *   at DAC block rate. No shared state between tasks or cores.
 *
 * Amplitude Scaling:
 *   The mono and difference outputs are typically scaled differently before mixing:
 *     * Mono: unity gain (full 0 dB)
 *     * Difference: -6 dB (0.5x) for DSB-SC modulation onto subcarrier
 *   This scaling is done by MPXMixer, not by this module.
